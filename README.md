# Print-the-Elements-of-a-Linked-List
This C# program builds and prints a simple singly linked list, where nodes chain together to store integers dynamically. It defines a `SinglyLinkedListNode` for each data-holding link and a `SinglyLinkedList` class with an `InsertNode` method that appends new nodes to the tail. The `printLinkedList` function traverses from the head, printing each node's data until the end. In `Main`, it reads the list size from input, loops to insert that many integers, and then outputs the entire list line by lineâ€”ideal for demonstrating basic linked list operations!
